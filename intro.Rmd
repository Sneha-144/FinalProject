# 1. Introduction & Objectives

This project moves beyond simple descriptive statistics to apply **Master's Level Machine Learning and Spatial Analysis** techniques to the College Scorecard dataset.

**Our Research Objectives:**

1.  **Earnings (Non-Linear):** Can we predict 10-year earnings using *Random Forest* to capture non-linear curriculum effects?

2.  **Graduation Rate (Interaction):** Does the impact of a "Tech Focus" depend on the *School Type* (Elite vs. Budget)?

3.  **Classification (SVM):** Can a *Support Vector Machine* accurately classify "High Value" schools?

4.  **Spatial Analysis (Geography):** Do "Education Deserts" (geographic isolation) negatively impact completion rates?
